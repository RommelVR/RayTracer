# RayTracer
A Haskell implementation of Andrew Kensler's business card ray tracer.


## How to build?
If you don't want to be waiting for several minutes, your best bet is to ensure `-O` flag is enabled when compiling.

`ghc -O Tracer.hs`


## How to run?
`./Tracer > output.ppm`


## Output
![example][1]


## Known Issues
This rendition of the ray tracer does not do any multi-sampling (yet) or lambert illumination of the ground tiling.

Special thanks to `#haskell` for helping me with my million questions.
